virus.js
=====

A simple Node.js virus to demonstrate how digital viral infections work.

## What it Does

The viral code will copy itself to all .js files under a directory; defaults to the directory the virus.js file resides in. Any infected file, when executed will further scan its directory for uninfected files, and infect them.

The infected files will sing a song on Fridays, when they are executed. It could be made more fun or dangerous, though.

## WARNING

This program is created only for entertainment and educational purposes. Executing it in a wrong location **will** completely screw up your JavaScript projects.

DO NOT EXECUTE THIS PROGRAM IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES.
